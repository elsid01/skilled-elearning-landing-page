                          STEP 1

              ANALYZING THE DESIGN MOCKUP


       1.1 First Impression of the Design Mockup

       This project is a landing page of educational company.
       The design is simple and elegant.        

       There are some differences between the mobile,
       the tablet, and the desktop layout.  
       The parts after hero section are organized 
       in a grid of 2 column and 3 row for the tablet, 3 columns and 2 rows for 
       the desktop, and 1 column in the mobile version.

       Also, the font are the same in tablet and mobile. 
       But spaces must be resized in responsive.

       There is breakings point specifications give in the design.
       They will be determined by how we adjust these parts to various 
       browser window sizes.

      boundaries, we can split it in to 4 parts.

       The design flow is a top to bottom eye flow pattern
       lined up vertically
